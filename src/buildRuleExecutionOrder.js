/**
 * Rules can be ordered by users at the event type level. For example, assume both Rule A and Rule B
 * use the Library Loaded and Window Loaded event types. Rule A can be ordered to come before Rule B
 * on Library Loaded but after Rule B on Window Loaded.
 *
 * Order values are integers and act more as a priority. In other words, multiple rules can have the
 * same order value. If they have the same order value, their order of execution should be
 * considered nondetermistic.
 *
 * @param {Array} rules
 * @returns {Array} An ordered array of rule-event pair objects.
